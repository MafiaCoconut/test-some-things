The previous AI engineer, E1, initiated the development of a Monstrino social network, transitioning from a basic landing page to a complex application for Monster High doll collectors. Initially, the focus was on a conversion-optimized landing page using a specific BigFish design playbook and Shadcn UI. This quickly evolved into implementing core application pages (Collections, User, Doll View) based on detailed wireframe descriptions. A significant architectural shift involved rewriting the entire frontend using Material-UI (MUI) components, driven by user requests for enhanced aesthetics and specific layout changes.

Subsequent iterations focused on adding robust features like user profile editing, collection management, activity feeds, achievements, and comprehensive legal pages with Mattel disclaimers. The agent also implemented extensive UI/UX refinements, including responsive design, custom headers with search and notifications, and dynamic menus. Throughout, the engineer used mock data exclusively, with backend integration (email endpoints) remaining pending. The current state is mid-way through implementing advanced frontend features, having encountered a  after recent edits related to notification modals and menu re-positioning.

The initial goal was a conversion-optimized landing page for a Monstrino Monster High social network, targeting ages 10-30, with a gothic aesthetic, interactive modals (login/register), email subscription, and responsive design, adhering to the BigFish design system. This evolved into building a full social network app.

Current product features include:
- **Pages**: Landing page, All Collections, Individual Collection, User Profile, Friends, Groups, Doll View, Help Center, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Safety Guidelines, About Us, Contact, Posts, Settings.
- **User Profile**: User info (avatar, username, bio), Monster Status, editable profile data, user settings, horizontal scroller for favorite dolls, activity feed. Collections menu moved to right wall and vertical.
- **Collections Management**: Create, edit, add/remove dolls in collections, view collection details, doll cards with specific info.
- **Social Features**: Friends list, Groups list (with posts, subscribers, info, images, admins), user posts with tags, achievements system on profile.
- **Navigation/UI**: Fixed header with clickable Monstrino logo (redirects to home), search bar, notifications button with modal, user avatar menu (page, settings, logout), left sidebar with Settings button.
- **Legal**: All legal pages include Mattel disclaimers, copyright notices, and non-commercial fan project declarations to avoid litigation.
- **Design**: Strict use of Material-UI (MUI) components, Monster High gothic aesthetic (dark theme, vibrant pink/purple/yellow accents), responsive design for all screen sizes, specific layout adjustments for User and Collections pages.
- **Backend (Pending)**: Email endpoint for newsletter subscription and v1.0 release.

- **Frontend**: React.js, Material-UI (MUI) for UI components, Tailwind CSS for styling,  for conditional class joining, Swiper.js and Framer Motion for animations/sliders,  for navigation, Axios for API calls.
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) for API endpoints, MongoDB (via ) for database,  for environment variables,  for IDs.
- **Design Systems**: Initial adherence to BigFish playbook, later full transition to Material Design principles via MUI.
- **Deployment**: Supervisor for service control, Kubernetes Ingress rules for API routing.

**Key Files and Their Importance:**

-   : The central routing file that defines all application routes and integrates the main layout components like  and . It also manages the initial backend Hello World call and was significantly modified to implement  and  for all new pages.
-   : The FastAPI backend entry point. It defines the  prefix for all routes, handles CORS, and includes basic  CRUD endpoints. It's important for understanding the backend's current minimal capabilities, with no further modifications related to the Monster High app beyond the initial setup.
-   : Crucial for the Material-UI aesthetic, defining custom colors, typography (Inter font), and component overrides to match the Monster High gothic style. This file dictates the visual consistency across the MUI components.
-   : Stores all mock data (users, collections, dolls, posts, friends, groups, achievements) used to power the frontend without a real backend. This file is vital for understanding the current data structure and content.
-   : This page is central to the user experience. It has undergone multiple significant overhauls to incorporate editable user data, monster status, horizontal favorite doll scroller, a re-positioned vertical collections menu on the right, activity feed, and specific button layouts.
-   : Manages the top-level navigation, including the clickable Monstrino logo, search bar, notifications button (now with a modal), and the user avatar dropdown menu (with links to user page, settings, and logout).
-   : Generated to outline the API contracts for future backend integration. It details which frontend mock data needs corresponding backend endpoints and how the integration should occur.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Backend Development**: Create an endpoint that sends email messages to users upon newsletter subscription and site release (v1.0).
-   **Email Template**: Develop an email template with a Monster High style footer for all outgoing emails.
-   **Bug Fix**: Resolve the  encountered in the last action.
-   **UI/UX Refinements (Post-Bug Fix)**: Ensure all components are flexible and dynamic for different screen sizes (PC, tablet, phone) as per the last request.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing a series of advanced frontend features and UI/UX refinements based on the user's detailed request in Chat Message 158. The core work involved:

1.  **Notification Modal**: Creating a modal to display notifications, replacing a simple menu.
2.  **Friends' Posts Menu**: Changing the My posts menu to display posts from the user's friends.
3.  **Collections Menu Repositioning (User Page)**: Moving the Collections menu on the user profile page to the right of the posts menu and under the favorite dolls showcase, ensuring it doesn't overlap other components. This implies a significant layout refactoring, likely involving flexible box or grid layouts.
4.  **Achievements List Menu**: Creating a dedicated menu to display the user's achievements.
5.  **Responsive Design**: Making the entire website, including component sizes and features, comfortable and flexible for various screen sizes (handy/mobile, tablet, PC).

The engineer made several file edits to , , and  to accommodate these changes. However, the last recorded action (Chat Message 166) shows a  during a screenshot attempt, indicating that the recent changes are not fully functional or have introduced a bug that needs fixing before the features can be confirmed as complete and correctly implemented.
